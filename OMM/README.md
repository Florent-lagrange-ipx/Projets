Open Micro Metha: the open-source micro anaerobic digestor

## The project
The __Open Micro Metha__ project is held at "La Paillasse Saône" in Villeurbanne, near Lyon, which is an experimental research and action laboratory for citizen projects specifically in the fields of cleantech and biotech: it's an eco-hacklab. More globally, "La Paillasse Saône" is located inside a broader local strucutre called "La M[Y]NE" which is a experimental laboratory for sustainable ways of consumption and production. 

The __Open Micro Metha__ project aims at prototyping, testing, experimenting and developping low-tech micro anaerobic digestors to produce biogaz from households or restauration biowaste. The ambition is to develop a robust enough and innovative open-source system that can not only be fork and replicate anywhere but also be the basis of an entrepreneurial adventure. 

The official webpage of the projet is [THIS ONE](http://leteaser.fr/openmicrometha).
The presentation video is [THIS ONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOgKKkc--5Q).
The Wiki Documentation Plateform used to document the projet is [THIS ONE](http://movilab.org/index.php?title=OpenMicroMetha).
WIll try to push documentation on the [Hackuarium Wiki](http://wiki.hackuarium.ch/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [Valldaura projects plateform](http://fr.padlet.com/valldauraaction/valldauralabs) as soon as possible.

### What, why and how the project is documented.

What are documented are:
* The process of fabrication and the various iterations of the development of the micro digestor prototypes.
* The experimentations and their results.

The documentation has two main objectives:
* First of all to set a clear and detailed fabrication notice for those who would like to test and experiment, upgrade and then contribute to the improvement of the prototype.
* Secondly to share the process of development and experimentations, as well as the results, reflexion and decisions that have been made in order for you to be able to replicate the experiment and strengthen (or not) the results that we ended with. 


The __Open Micro Metha__ project aims at being documented on several plateforms. 

To start:
* Wikis: the [Movilab](http://movilab.org/) plateform and the [Hackuarium Wiki](http://wiki.hackuarium.ch/index.php?title=Main_Page). 
* GItHub: here you are. 
* Other plateform: [Valldaura projects plateform](http://fr.padlet.com/valldauraaction/valldauralabs).

Then, the ambition is to largely diffuse the documentation thourhg cross plateform and decentralised documentation sheets using plateform such as [Multibao's plateform](http://www.multibao.org/multibao/contributions/pages).

Finally, we hope that the documentation will be appropriable and forkable for you to upgrade, improve and contribute through your own documentation.


## Prototypes

Up to date, there are 2 main protoype iterations:
* The first prototype has been developped within the scope of the [OSCE Days](http://community.oscedays.org/) in Mouans-Sartoux in the south of France. Live documentation (that is to say the documentation developed during the process of fabrication) can be found at [THIS ADDRESS](https://omm.hackpad.com/OSCEDays-ProtoOMM-v1-Mouans-Sartoux-Yi4Tc0emWbv). Documentation of the fabrication process of the prototype in french language is available on the [Movilab](http://movilab.org/) plateform at [THIS ADDRESS](http://movilab.org/index.php?title=OpenMicroMetha_protoype_V1#.C3.80_faire_apr.C3.A8s). 

* The second prototype has been developped within the scope the first [SummerCamps] (https://lapaillassaone.wordpress.com/summercamp-1-a-la-myne/) at "La M[Y]NE", the open civic laboratory for sustainable ways of consumption and production located near Lyon in Villeurbanne in France. Live documentation (that is to say the documentation developed during the process of fabrication) can be found at [THIS ADDRESS](https://omm.hackpad.com/HackOMM-Open-Micro-Metha-MyneCamp-Proto-OMM-V2-NvmgBtoWk3Y). Documentation of the fabrication process of the prototype in french language will be soon available on the [Movilab](http://movilab.org/) plateform.
